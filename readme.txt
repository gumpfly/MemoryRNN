‘RUNMNIST.sh’ - Linux Bash file to automatically train on the delayed classification task on MNIST, for both GRU and LSTM unit types, VoCu and DeCu training, and all types of regularization (including control) and for 10 instances per setting and test accuracy for increasing delays.

TriggerMNISTSpeedCont.py - Trains RNN for delayed classication on MNIST. Can choose Curriculum (VoCu, DeCu or none), Architecture (LSTM or GRU) and regularization (none, center-of-mass speed or slow-point speed)

BlackBoxFunctions.py - Contains helper fucntions to perfrom the BlackBox algorithm and the slow-points speed regularization

BlackBoxMNIST.py - Performs the BlackBox algorithm for the networks generated by ‘TriggerMNISTSpeedCont.py’

AccMNIST.py - Measures retrieval accuracy on test set for increasing delays.

TriggerCIFARSpeedCont.py, BlackBoxCIFAR.py, AccCIFAR.py - Same as above, but for CIFAR-10 Dataset.

All scripts utilize 'BlackBoxFunctions.py'
